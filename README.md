# iPad Photo Frame updates

Public distribution of signed application-only updates for the family iPad photo frame.

`metadata/` contains TUF-signed verification metadata. `targets/frame.zip` contains only the app HTML, Python server and layout/shuffle/face helpers. No photos, album links, device settings, credentials or private signing keys are included. The development source repository remains private.

The iPad bootstraps trust from a public root installed over USB and verifies downloads before activation. HTTPS delivery is not a substitute for signature verification.

App adaptation is MIT licensed; the original project is [carlosbaraza/old-ipad-photo-frame](https://github.com/carlosbaraza/old-ipad-photo-frame), commit a7cec3229be1cd644e5f39e92adf6d6b80582edf.

## Current release

`frame-ota-11` (sequence 11), published 2026-10-28: tap a photo in a mosaic to view it individually, fitted to the screen. The slideshow resumes after the configured interval or a second tap. The photo stays enlarged while fading to the next slide.

Interaction tests cover touch selection, timers, rotation, swipes and transitions. The signed five-file package was verified against the source. The iPad was unavailable for device testing.

Includes shuffle and mosaic fixes from `frame-ota-10`, private reporting from `frame-ota-9`, diagnostics from `frame-ota-8`, bilingual release notes from `frame-ota-7`, Settings improvements, automatic updates and photo motion. The existing updater, trust root and five-file package format are unchanged.
